# Project Title: Video Metadata Fixer
Video files often come from a wide array of sources, leading to inconsistencies and inaccuracies in their metadataâ€”such as audio language, resolution, bitrate, and codec. This project aims to develop a user-friendly GUI application for Windows and Linux that allows users to select a folder containing video files. The tool will identify metadata issues, retrieve accurate data, and update the video files accordingly, ensuring that your media library is organized and properly tagged.
